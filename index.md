...and I already hate it. 

(Go ahead, write me off as a fringe Luddite lunatics, despite us all living in a technocratic dystopia, despite this site being hosted on Github pages or whatever.)

Anyways, I guess I just got so sick of people assuming I'm not "real" because I don't do socials. So here it is, my internet proof of existence. Here's where I'll link to my writing and share updates.

Love and "hello world" and whatnot, 

adrien (any/all)
