Hello world, I finally have an internet presence, after being offline media for years.

(Go ahead, write me off as one of those fringe Luddite lunatics.)

I guess I got tired of people assuming I'm not "real" because I'm not on socials... So here it is, my internet proof of existence. Here I will link to my writing, and share updates when it makes sense to do so.

Love, adrien (any/all)
Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, Adrien Minsan now lives in NYC and works in research science. Why does Adrien write? Because itâ€™s fun and free and the alternative is to not.
