I guess I got tired of people assuming I'm not "real" because I'm not on socials. So here it is, my internet proof of existence. 

Love and "hello world" and whatnot, 

adrien (any/all)

P.S.
Now that you're here, check out:
- a video game I made <a href="https://loss-leader-games.itch.io/skinscare">about the horrors of having a skin care routine</a>
- a short story I wrote <a href="https://www.littleoldladycomedy.com/all-works/5vk6glpyyqbauydsdqbnes8cxw3znf">about a Halloween fling with a hot dog (well, sorta)</a>
- a trailer for <a href="https://vimeo.com/1095735965">my comedy about insurance, roommates, and a dermoid cyst</a> 
<br>(9/30/25: It got into the NYC Short Comedy Film Festival!)
