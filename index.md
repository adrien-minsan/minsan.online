title: I finally have an internet presence...

...after being offline for years. (Go ahead, write me off as one of those fringe Luddite lunatics.)

I guess I got tired of people assuming I'm not "real" because I'm not on socials... So here it is, my internet proof of existence. Here I will link to my writing and share updates.

Hello world and whatnot, 
adrien (any/all)



Born and raised in the Pacific Northwest, Adrien Minsan now lives in NYC and works in research science. Why does Adrien write? Because it’s fun and free and the alternative is to not.
