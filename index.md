...after being offline for years. (Go ahead, write me off as one of those fringe Luddite lunatics.)

I guess I got tired of people assuming I'm not "real" because I'm not on socials... So here it is, my internet proof of existence. Here I will link to my writing and share updates.

Hello world and whatnot, 
adrien (any/all)
