...and I already hate it. (Go ahead, write me off as one of those fringe Luddite lunatics.)

But I guess I got tired of people assuming I'm not "real" because I'm no longer on socials. So here it is, my internet proof of existence. Here I will link to my writing and share updates.

Love and "hello world" and what not, 

adrien (any/all)
